"Handscraper" is an Email scraper for the job board Handshake. This Chrome extension is designed to automate the extraction of email addresses from any Handshake employer listings (i.e. from pages of the type https://*.joinhandshake.com/stu/employers/* (see attached screenshots)). It efficiently navigates through multiple pages, gathering emails from employer listings, and allows for quick export to a text file. A handy tool for facilitating easier outreach for students, job seekers, and professionals.

Usage:
1. Log into Handshake, select the "Employers" tab from the left pane, and set any desired filters of your choice.
3. Activate the extension and select "Start Scraping" from the pop-up. You should ideally see new tabs open and close in the background, indicating that scraping has begun. Please keep your computer awake while scraping is in progress. I'd also recommend not minimizing the chrome window.
4. The extension will automatically download a text file with the emails of all the listed employers as soon as scraping completes. You can also export the list of emails extracted so far at any point in time while the scraping is in progress using the "Export Emails" button.

This shouldn't happen normally, but if for whatever the reason the extension stops scraping midway or ends scraping after scraping only a portion of all the employers, please reload the page and run it again :p If the page itself crashes, please try clearing cache and cookies, closing any other chrome windows/extensions that may be running in the background, and running it in incognito.
